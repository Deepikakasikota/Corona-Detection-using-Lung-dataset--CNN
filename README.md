# Corona-Detection-using-Lung-dataset--CNN
Here, I use Lung dataset to predict if patient is effected to COVID or not.

## About Dataset:

Here, the dataset contains two folders.

- 1 : Covid
- 2 : Normal

We have 151 images in each folder.
Using these two folders we have to findout the patient is effected to covid or not.
